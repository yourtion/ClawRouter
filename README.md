ClawRouter is a smart LLM router for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). It classifies each request, picks the cheapest model that can handle it, and pays per-request via [x402](https://x402.org) USDC micropayments on Base. No account, no API key — your wallet signs each payment.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install
openclaw plugin install claw-router

# 2. Set your wallet key
export BLOCKRUN_WALLET_KEY=0x...

# 3. Enable smart routing
openclaw config set model blockrun/auto
```

Every request now routes to the cheapest capable model. Fund your wallet with USDC on Base to start.

Want a specific model instead? `openclaw config set model openai/gpt-4o` — you still get x402 payments and usage logging.

## How Routing Works

Hybrid rules-first approach. Heuristic rules handle ~80% of requests in <1ms at zero cost. Only ambiguous queries hit the LLM classifier.

```
Request → Rule-based scorer (< 1ms, free)
            ├── Clear → pick model → done
            └── Ambiguous → LLM classifier (~200ms, ~$0.00003)
                              └── classify → pick model → done
```

### Rules Engine

8 scoring dimensions: token count, code presence, reasoning markers, technical terms, creative markers, simple indicators, multi-step patterns, question complexity.

Score maps to a tier:

| Score | Tier | Primary Model | Output $/M | vs GPT-4o |
|-------|------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| ≤ 0 | SIMPLE | gemini-2.5-flash | $0.60 | **94% cheaper** |
| 1-2 | *ambiguous* | → LLM classifier | — | — |
| 3-4 | MEDIUM | deepseek-chat | $0.42 | **96% cheaper** |
| 5-6 | COMPLEX | claude-sonnet-4 | $15.00 | higher quality |
| 7+ | REASONING | o3 | $8.00 | **20% cheaper** |

### LLM Classifier Fallback

When rules score in the ambiguous zone (1-2), ClawRouter sends the first 500 characters to `gemini-2.5-flash` with `max_tokens: 10` and asks for one word: SIMPLE, MEDIUM, COMPLEX, or REASONING. Cost per classification: ~$0.00003. Results cached for 1 hour.

### Estimated Savings

| Tier | % of Traffic | Output $/M |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| SIMPLE | 40% | $0.60 |
| MEDIUM | 30% | $0.42 |
| COMPLEX | 20% | $15.00 |
| REASONING | 10% | $8.00 |
| **Weighted avg** | | **$3.67/M — 63% savings vs GPT-4o** |

Every routed request logs its decision:

```
[ClawRouter] deepseek-chat (MEDIUM, rules, confidence=0.85)
             Cost: $0.0004 | Baseline: $0.0095 | Saved: 95.8%
```

## Models

30+ models across 5 providers, all through one wallet:

| Model | Input $/M | Output $/M | Context | Reasoning |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|:---------:|
| **OpenAI** | | | | |
| gpt-5.2 | $1.75 | $14.00 | 400K | * |
| gpt-5-mini | $0.25 | $2.00 | 200K | |
| gpt-5-nano | $0.05 | $0.40 | 128K | |
| gpt-4o | $2.50 | $10.00 | 128K | |
| gpt-4o-mini | $0.15 | $0.60 | 128K | |

## Payment

No account. No API key. Payment IS authentication via [x402](https://x402.org).

```
Request → 402 (price: $0.003) → wallet signs USDC → retry → response
```

USDC stays in your wallet until the moment each request is paid — non-custodial. The price is visible in the 402 response before your wallet signs.

**Pricing formula:**

```
Price = (input_tokens × input_rate) + (max_output_tokens × output_rate)
```

**Funding your wallet** — send USDC on Base to your wallet address:
- Coinbase — buy USDC, send to Base
- Any CEX — withdraw USDC to Base
- Bridge — move USDC from any chain to Base

## Usage Logging

Every routed request is logged as a JSON line:

```
~/.openclaw/blockrun/logs/usage-2026-02-03.jsonl
```

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-02-03T20:15:30.123Z",
  "model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash",
  "tier": "SIMPLE",
  "method": "rules",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "costEstimate": 0.000246,
  "baselineCost": 0.004097,
  "savings": 0.94,
  "latencyMs": 1250
}
```

## Configuration

### Override Routing

```yaml
# openclaw.yaml
plugins:
  - id: "claw-router"
    config:
      routing:
        tiers:
          COMPLEX:
            primary: "openai/gpt-4o"
          SIMPLE:
            primary: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
        scoring:
          reasoningKeywords: ["proof", "theorem", "formal verification"]
```

### Pin a Model

Skip routing. Use one model for everything:

```bash
openclaw config set model openai/gpt-4o
```

You still get x402 payments and usage logging.

```

The plugin runs a local HTTP proxy between OpenClaw and BlockRun's API. OpenClaw sees a standard OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `localhost`. Routing is **client-side** — open source and inspectable.

```
OpenClaw Agent
    │
    ▼
ClawRouter (localhost proxy)
    │  ① Classify query (rules → LLM fallback)
    │  ② Pick cheapest capable model
    │  ③ Sign x402 USDC payment
    │
    ▼
BlockRun API → Provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, xAI)
```

## Programmatic Usage

Use ClawRouter as a library without OpenClaw:

```typescript
import { startProxy } from "claw-router";

const proxy = await startProxy({
  walletKey: process.env.BLOCKRUN_WALLET_KEY!,
  onReady: (port) => console.log(`Proxy on port ${port}`),
  onRouted: (d) => {
    const saved = (d.savings * 100).toFixed(0);
    console.log(`${d.model} (${d.tier}) saved ${saved}%`);
  },
});

// Use with any OpenAI-compatible client
const res = await fetch(`${proxy.baseUrl}/v1/chat/completions`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "blockrun/auto",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What is 2+2?" }],
  }),
});

await proxy.close();
```

Or use the router directly:

```typescript
import { route, DEFAULT_ROUTING_CONFIG } from "claw-router";

const decision = await route("Prove sqrt(2) is irrational", undefined, 4096, {
  config: DEFAULT_ROUTING_CONFIG,
  modelPricing,
  payFetch,
  apiBase: "https://api.blockrun.ai/api",
});

console.log(decision);
// {
//   model: "openai/o3",
//   tier: "REASONING",
//   confidence: 0.9,
//   method: "rules",
//   savings: 0.20,
//   costEstimate: 0.032776,
//   baselineCost: 0.040970,
// }
```

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blockrunai/claw-router.git
cd claw-router
npm install
npm run build        # Build with tsup
npm run dev          # Watch mode
npm run typecheck    # Type check

# Run tests
npx tsup test/e2e.ts --format esm --outDir test/dist --no-dts
node test/dist/e2e.js

# Run with live proxy (requires funded wallet)
BLOCKRUN_WALLET_KEY=0x... node test/dist/e2e.js
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Provider plugin — one wallet, 30+ models, x402 payment proxy
- [x] Smart routing — hybrid rules + LLM classifier, 4-tier model selection
- [x] Usage logging — JSON lines to disk, per-request cost tracking
- [ ] Graceful fallback — auto-switch on rate limit or provider error
- [ ] Spend controls — daily/monthly budgets, server-side enforcement
- [ ] Cost dashboard — analytics at blockrun.ai

## Why Not OpenRouter / LiteLLM?

They're built for developers — create an account, get an API key, prepay a balance, manage it through a dashboard.

ClawRouter is built for **agents**. The difference:

| | OpenRouter / LiteLLM | ClawRouter |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | Human creates account, gets API key | Agent generates wallet, pays per request |
| **Payment** | Prepaid balance (custodial) | Per-request micropayment (non-custodial) |
| **Auth** | API key (shared secret) | Wallet signature (cryptographic proof) |
| **Custody** | Provider holds your money | USDC stays in YOUR wallet until spent |
| **Routing** | Proprietary / closed | Open source, client-side, inspectable |

As agents become autonomous, they need financial infrastructure designed for machines. An agent shouldn't need a human to sign up for a service and paste an API key. It should generate a wallet, receive funds, and pay per request — programmatically.
